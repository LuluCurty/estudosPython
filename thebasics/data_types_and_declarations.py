#Data types are int, float, str and boolean 
#To declare any variable, you just need to follow the syntax:

# var_name: type

i_am_one_variable: int

#or you can just start it with one value. 
#The python interpreter is powerfull


#This line is read as i_am_one_initialized_variable (RECIEVES) "I have one value!!!"
#keep in mind that = means recieves
i_am_one_initialized_variable = "I have one value!!!"
