#okay, maybe I'm going too fast, but belive me! This is simple
#This line of code is used to import things from other files
#As it is in the github, both files are in the same folder(dir)
#This means the following syntax:

# from somewhere import anything
#now I will import all variables 
#from file 'data_types_and_declarations.py'

from data_types_and_declarations import *

#okay, now it's time to use our variables!
#follow me, we will output both variables that we made there

print(f"This is one variable: {i_am_one_initialized_variable}")

#Wow, it works! 
#Now, let's see how the syntax works

# print(f string {variable})

a = 1
print(f"a means {a}")

a = i_am_one_initialized_variable
print(f"i can change the value of a and print it!\nLike this {a}")

# \n means "new line" it is used to put another line in the console


#congratulations! Now you've learned the basics!!! We can follow anything now
